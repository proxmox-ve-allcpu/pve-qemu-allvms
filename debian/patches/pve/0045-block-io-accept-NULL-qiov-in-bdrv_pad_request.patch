Subject: [PATCH] block/io: accept NULL qiov in bdrv_pad_request

Some operations, e.g. block-stream, perform reads while discarding the
results (only copy-on-read matters). In this case they will pass NULL as
the target QEMUIOVector, which will however trip bdrv_pad_request, since
it wants to extend its passed vector.

Simply check for NULL and do nothing, there's no reason to pad the
target if it will be discarded anyway.
